# Shopping App
PS: Code files are removed. Only images and info to showcase the app.
An online shopping app where you can search and scroll through different products or categories. 

- You can select a product to view details and price. Double clicking the product image will add it to your wishlist! 
- If you switch to "My Cart" tab from the bottom tab view, i've added a cute little cart animation as a cherry on top.
- Looking at the top left corner, there's a cart items count and if your cart is empty, once again a beautiful animation is ready to pop. 

**Note:** The color palette is inspired by an Instagram post.
